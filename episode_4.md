`Episode 4` is kinda misleading:

* I don't agree with the messaging of this episode. He's basically saying economy is more important than the well-being of the country itself. Economy doing good doesn't naturally mean that the country is doing good too. Best example would be India right now.<sup>[[1]](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-you-are-not-investing-finance-minister-to-industry/articleshow/94187630.cms)</sup>\
\
This kind of belief stems from an inherent Eliteism that is seen quite often in the Economics profession, probably because of their historic proximity to power. Unlearning Economics explained it better.<sup>[[2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeMcVo3WFOY)</sup>

* He didn't mentioned that the coup in Chile was orchestrated & funded by the CIA. Salvador Allende was in power for less than 3 yrs, it took Chile ~30 yrs to recover after Pinnoche took over; if we would've given time to Allende, maybe he would've fixed the economy sooner. I'm just saying that the comparison is not fair here & has a very strong American bias.<sup>[[3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3rp7Hs1Sjo)</sup>

* **The American Bias:** The coup happened in 1973, it was close to *the Cold War* & USA had gone through a phase known as *the Red Scare* (aka McCarthyism).<sup>[[4]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N35IugBYH04)</sup> US government was very brutal during this time & went after anyone even suspected of having left of center views. They never recovered from it, even now amongst the 2 major parties in USA, one is a right-wing party (Democrats) & the other is a far-right party (Republicans).\
\
Chile is a success story for USA as they succedded in toppling the Chilean government, they failed to do so in Cuba & Vietnam.\
\
Cuba is a very good example of how far USA can go to prove their point. Cuba by no means is doing economically good today but it is not because it is under Communist government. It is because of a 60 yrs long trade embargo imposed by USA to cripple its economy, in hopes that the people might get angry & start a civil war in the country.<sup>[[5]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpjDyhGyjNk)</sup> Our Spanish deplomat recently critisized USA for its blockade in Cuba in the UN.<sup>[[6]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syrt1X_HGXE)</sup>

* Some places in Chile is going through an ecological breakdown because of Lithium mining. This is the problem of an economic model (Capitalism) that relies on perpetual growth, resources are finite in the planet.<sup>[[7]](https://youtu.be/KLiXmteCvUI?list=PLzGHKb8i9vTzRKnjR5JDlXQPkiGe2Gjd5) [[8]](https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/02/01/south-america-s-lithium-fields-reveal-the-dark-side-of-our-electric-future)</sup>
